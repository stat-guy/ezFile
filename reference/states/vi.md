# U.S. Virgin Islands Tax Reference

## Overview

The U.S. Virgin Islands uses a **"mirror code" tax system** -- USVI applies the federal Internal Revenue Code but substitutes "Virgin Islands" for "United States." USVI residents file a mirror of the federal Form 1040 with the USVI Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) instead of the IRS.

## Key Facts About USVI Taxation

### Mirror Code System

The USVI "mirrors" the entire U.S. Internal Revenue Code:
- Same tax brackets as federal
- Same standard deduction as federal
- Same credits and deductions
- But taxes are paid to the USVI government, NOT the IRS

### Who Files Where

| Situation | IRS Return? | USVI Return? |
|---|---|---|
| USVI resident, USVI employer | **No** | **Yes** (mirror 1040) |
| USVI resident with U.S.-source income | **Yes** (for U.S. income) | **Yes** |
| U.S. resident who moved from USVI mid-year | **Yes** | **Yes** (part-year) |

### W-2 Box 15-17 for USVI

If Box 15 shows "VI":
- The employee likely lives and works in the USVI
- Box 16: USVI wages
- Box 17: USVI income tax withheld
- The employee files with USVI BIR, not the IRS

### Economic Development Commission (EDC) Benefits

Some USVI residents qualify for EDC benefits that provide a **90% credit** on USVI taxes. This is a major tax incentive but only applies to qualifying businesses/individuals.

## EZFile Scope Limitation

**EZFile is designed for federal Form 1040 filers.** If the user's only income is USVI-source and they live in the USVI:

> "The U.S. Virgin Islands uses a 'mirror' of the federal tax code -- same brackets and rules, but you file with the USVI Bureau of Internal Revenue instead of the IRS. EZFile is designed for federal IRS returns and cannot process USVI mirror returns. File your return with the USVI BIR at vibir.gov or consult a local tax professional."

**If the user has BOTH IRS and USVI income:** This is a complex multi-jurisdiction situation outside EZFile's scope.

## What to Tell the User

> "Your W-2 shows the U.S. Virgin Islands. USVI uses a 'mirror' of the federal tax code -- same rates and rules, but filed with the USVI Bureau of Internal Revenue instead of the IRS. EZFile can't process USVI returns. File your mirror return at vibir.gov or consult a USVI tax professional."
