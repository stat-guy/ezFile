# Puerto Rico Tax Reference

## Overview

Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with its own **completely separate tax system**. PR residents generally do NOT file a federal Form 1040 for income earned in Puerto Rico. This makes PR fundamentally different from the 50 states and D.C.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Tax system | **Separate** -- PR has its own tax code |
| Form | Planilla (PR income tax return) |
| Filing deadline | April 15 |
| Follows federal AGI? | **No** -- PR has its own income definitions |
| Federal return required? | **Generally no** for PR-source income |

## Key Facts About PR Taxation

### Who Files Where

| Situation | Federal Return? | PR Return? |
|---|---|---|
| PR resident, PR employer | **No** (usually) | **Yes** |
| PR resident, federal employer (military, USPS) | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| PR resident with U.S.-source income | **Yes** (for U.S. income) | **Yes** |
| U.S. resident who moved from PR mid-year | **Yes** | **Yes** (part-year) |

### PR Tax Rates (Progressive, 2025)

Puerto Rico has steep progressive rates:

| Taxable Income | Rate |
|---|---|
| $0 - $9,000 | 0% |
| $9,001 - $25,000 | 7% |
| $25,001 - $41,500 | 14% |
| $41,501 - $61,500 | 25% |
| Over $61,500 | 33% |

**Note:** These rates are significantly higher than most U.S. states, but PR residents don't pay federal income tax on PR-source income.

### W-2 Box 15-17 for PR

If Box 15 shows "PR":
- The employee likely lives and works in Puerto Rico
- Box 16: PR wages
- Box 17: PR income tax withheld
- The employee may NOT need a federal return at all

## EZFile Scope Limitation

**EZFile is designed for federal Form 1040 filers.** If the user's only income is PR-source and they live in PR:

> "Puerto Rico has its own tax system separate from the federal government. Since your W-2 shows Puerto Rico, you likely need to file a Puerto Rico Planilla (PR income tax return) rather than a federal Form 1040. EZFile is designed for federal returns and cannot calculate PR taxes. File your PR return at suri.hacienda.pr.gov or consult a CPA familiar with Puerto Rico taxation."

**If the user has BOTH federal and PR income:** They may need both returns, but this is a complex multi-jurisdiction situation outside EZFile's scope.

## What to Tell the User

> "Your W-2 shows Puerto Rico. PR has its own separate tax system -- PR residents generally don't file federal returns for PR income. EZFile can't calculate PR taxes. File your PR return through SURI at suri.hacienda.pr.gov, or consult a tax professional familiar with Puerto Rico taxation."
